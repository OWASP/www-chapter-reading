# Welcome to OWASP Reading Chapter

We welcome you to join our band of App Sec enthusiasts and share your ideas and knowledge to the world!

As you may be aware of, Reading is one of UK's top digital cities and hosts a multitude of IT companies across different disciplines - AI and Data, ECommerce, Cyber, Digital, Gaming, IoT, Medical Technology and FinTech.

How exciting would it be see AppSec through the lenses of all these people and get a chance to interact with them?
